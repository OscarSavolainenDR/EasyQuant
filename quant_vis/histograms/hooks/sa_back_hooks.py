    A backward hook that measures the gradient being fed back through a quantization module.

    The hook will capture the backwards gradient, and map it to the same histogram bins as were
    used for the histograms in the forward hook. This will make it so that the gradients will be summed
    into bins that correspond to the forward values, so that they can be associated. If the output of the
